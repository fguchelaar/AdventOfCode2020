# 10 Adapter Array

Tribonnaci... who would have thought :)

For part 1 you first calucate the number of necessary 'three jolts'. Then 
subtract that from the total number of adapters. Multiply to get the answer.

Part 2 needed some extra digging and tribonnaci was the 'key'. First I find
all pairs of 'one jolts'. Then using tribonnaci it is possible to count the
number of variations. Multiply them all to get the answer.
