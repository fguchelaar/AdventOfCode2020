# 23 [Crab Cups] 

For part 1 a circular list structure works well. As I already knew it wouldn't cut it for part 2,
I didn't take the time to neaten it very much.

Part 2 is solved by using a map, where each key (a cup label) points to the cup positioned after it. 
That pretry fast and solves part 2 in about three seconds; good enough.
