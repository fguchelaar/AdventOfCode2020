# 20 [Jurassic Jigsaw] 

## Part 1

For part 1 I'm trying to find the corners, by finding the only 4 tiles that
have only 2 lined up edges with other tiles.

## Part 2

From what I've learned from part 1, I tried to see if the same approach would 
work for edges: tiles with only 3 lined up edges. That seems to work.

So the end-result is a big pile of messy code, that could use cleanup. I might 
do that sometime..
