# 07 Handy Haversacks

&lt;rant&gt;

🤮 ugly one today... After struggling the entire day with my UniFi setup, I 
lacked motivation to come up with something nice. I don't really like the 
parsing of the input and the recursion looks pretty messy as well...

But it calculates the answer pretty fast, so there you go.

&lt;/rant&gt;

Fairly easy solution, which could probably benefit from some memoization; maybe 
next time...
